Assignment 1: Neural Network vs. TensorFlow Logistic Regression
Objective: Build a neural network from scratch and compare its performance to TensorFlow's logistic regression model. The task is to predict the weight of penguins using various attributes.

Folder: assignment_1
Files: Contains the neural network implementation, TensorFlow logistic regression, and datasets.
Assignment 2: Pretrained Model vs. Regular CNN for Movie Genre Prediction
Objective: Compare a pretrained model with a regular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine if movie genres can be predicted using only the movie posters.

Folder: assignment_2
Files: Includes code for the regular CNN, pretrained model setup, and datasets of movie posters.
Assignment 3: RNN vs. Transformer for Language Translation
Objective: Compare the performance of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Transformer model for bidirectional translation between English and Spanish.

Folder: assignment_3
Files: Contains the RNN and Transformer model implementations, training scripts, and translation datasets.
Reports
Each assignment folder includes a detailed report that documents the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions. These reports provide deeper insights into the comparative studies conducted in each assignment.

Usage
