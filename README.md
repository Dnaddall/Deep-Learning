## Assignment 1: Neural Network vs. TensorFlow Logistic Regression
Objective: Build a neural network from scratch and compare its performance to TensorFlow's logistic regression model. The task is to predict the weight of penguins using various attributes.


## Assignment 2: Pretrained Model vs. Regular CNN for Movie Genre Prediction
Objective: Compare a pretrained model with a regular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine if movie genres can be predicted using only the movie posters.


## Assignment 3: RNN vs. Transformer for Language Translation
Objective: Compare the performance of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Transformer model for bidirectional translation between English and Spanish.

## Reports 
Each assignment folder includes a detailed report that documents the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions. These reports provide deeper insights into the comparative studies conducted in each assignment.
